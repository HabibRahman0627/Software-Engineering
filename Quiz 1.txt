3 important reasons of iterative development:

1. Enables and encourages user feedback.
2. Development focuses on critical issues.
3. Inconsistencies detected early.

Most important for our MUMScrum project: Development focuses on critical issues.

Reason: As our time period is limited, we should focus on to develop the critical issues of mumScrum project.
